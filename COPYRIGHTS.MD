# THE MACHINIMA VAULT - COPYRIGHTS

If you believe your rights have been infringed in some way, you may contact me through e-mail.
Please set the subject of your e-mail to: _"Copyright Infringement Machinima Vault"_ in order to prevent it from ending up in my spam box.
My e-mail may only be used for copyright infringement issues. Other e-mails will be ignored.
Please understand that if your e-mail ends up in my spam box nonetheless, there's only so much I can do to read it.
You can try to prevent this by re-sending the same email from another e-mail address.

##### I will send you a confirmation e-mail once I have received your e-mail.

##### From that moment on, I will do my best to send an official response to your claim as fast as possible. My aim is to respond within two weeks after sending a confirmation, depending on the situation. The given timeframe is an estimate. No rights can be derived from it.

Please construct your e-mail like this:

- Who you are, on whose behalf you are talking (can be, but not limited to you, your project, or a company, etc);
- Your position in this project so I know if you are in the position to send any copyright infringement claim;
- The part of the Machinima Vault that you believe infringes your copyright;
- Reasoning why you believe the Machinima Vault infringes your copyright;
- What issue is your team, project, company experiencing from the Machinima Vault using this asset;
- What you believe to be the best solution for this problem;

Thank you for your understanding!
