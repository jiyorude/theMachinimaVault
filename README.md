## INTRODUCTION
The Machinima Vault is an ever-expanding and freely-accessible information repository for those who are interested in the art of Machinima and the act of creating their own Machinima films. The repository contains extensive information about the concept of Machinima, modern-day Machinima practices and the Machinima Production pipeline. All of these facettes of can be found inside an ever-growing list of PC and console-based games/software from the past three decades. 

The Machinima Vault contains vast amounts of information regarding (experimental) machinima possibilities in many games, the process of choosing and installing mods, mod-use, required hardware and/or software, game manipulation, creating custom assets for your films such as objects or maps, cinematography tips and tricks and of course valuable insights towards the many facettes of machinima post-production such as video-editing, audio post-production, color grading and exporting your work.

The Machinima Vault contains everything one would need to get familiar with and up to speed with Machinima. The Vault was written and created by Jordy Veenstra: a machinimator who has created over 30 machinima films since he started making game-based cinema in 2007, out of which many of his films have received International acclaim and were featured on International art exhibitions, art galleries, museums, film study groups and film festivals around the world. Every little tiny thing I know about Machinima has been crammed into the Vault. Use it to your full advantage and have loads of fun while doing so.


## How To Use
The Vault can be accessed in two different ways:

- By visiting the [Live Demo Page](https://jiyorude.github.io/theMachinimaVault).
- By downloading the latest production build from the `Release` section and double-clicking on the `index.html` file in order to open it in your browser.

After every significant update, the Live Demo and the release page will be updated accordingly. I will do my best to update the entries on the Internet Archive's *Wayback Machine* as well for preservation purposes.

Once loading has been completed, you are presented with a couple of options:

- You can learn more about the Machinima Vault Project itself by clicking on the `About the Vault` page.
- You can read a concise literature review about the history of Machinima on the `About Machinima` page.
- A number of tips regarding scriptwriting, inspiration, creative concepting and planning can be found on the `Pre-Production` page.
- A number of tips regarding film post-production, such as Folder Structures and naming conventions, Editing, Motion Graphics, Color Grading, Audio Post-Production, recommended export settings etc. can be found on the `Post-Production` page.
- Or you can simply browse through the list of games found inside the Vault as you see fit. The Vault also contains a searchbar that allows you to search for a specific game, sorted by name, console, releaseyear, or genre.
