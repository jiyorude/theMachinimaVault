<p align="center" width="60%">The Machinima Vault is an ever-expanding, freely-accessible, retro-themed information repository for those who are interested in the art of Machinima and the act of creating their own. It contains extensive information about the concept of Machinima, how Machinima was born, modern-day Machinima practices and most importantly: how you are able to make your own Machinima inside an ever-growing list of PC and console-based games/software from the past three decades. The Machinima Vault contains vast amounts of information regarding (experimental) machinima possibilities in many games, choosing and installing mods, mod-use, required hardware and/or software, mod-installation, game manipulation, creating custom assets for your films such as objects or maps, cinematography tips and tricks, creating shots and of course valuable insights towards the many facettes of machinima post-production such as video-editing, audio post-production, color grading and exporting your work.</p>
<p align="center" width="60%">The Machinima Vault contains everything one would need to get familiar with and up to speed with Machinima. The Vault was written and created by Jordy Veenstra: a machinimator who has created over 30 machinima films since he started making game-based cinema in 2007, out of which many of his films have received International acclaim and were featured on International art exhibitions, art galleries, museums, film study groups and film festivals around the world. Every little tiny thing I know about Machinima has been crammed into the Vault. All of you have always been so supportive to me. The Machinima Vault is my gift back to you. Enjoy. Now get out there and make some killer Machinima!</p>
