### [6] - PLAGIARISM

It is strictly forbidden to plagiarize **(copying texts partially or in whole and passing them off as your own)** any part of the repository's content.

Be reminded that plagiarism is a form of fraud. Fraud can (depending on the context of the fraud) be considered a criminal offense. Only the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code _(excluding the HTML text content)_ may be freely used as you see fit for both non-commercial and commercial purposes without the need to cite.
In tandem, plagiarizing any of the images and/or vivdeo's found on the repository is forbidden.

### [7] - COMMERCIAL USE OF VIDEO AND PHOTO CONTENT

Commercial use of any of the screenshots and/or video's found in the repository is _PROHIBITED_ unless written permission has been given by me and the other
copyright holders involved. You are still responsible for getting proper copyright clearance from the other copyright holders involved for your intended purpose. Be reminded that even if I give permission, my permission is merely permission to use the existing media assets created by me for the Machinima Vault. It does not give you copyright clearance of any kind for the contents found within them. Any copyright claims due to improper use of the repository and improperly compliance with this rule are explicitly rejected.

### [9] - USE OF THE VAULT'S SOURCE CODE

You are _free_ to use, recycle, re-use and copy/paste (plagiarize if you will) parts of the HTML code structure (content found within is
** excluded ** as that is seen as plagiarism), CSS, JSX, Bootstrap, SASS and JavaScript raw code without the need for any citation. You are free to use any part of the raw code for both non commercial and commercial purposes. Again, the content found inside the HTML code (see section 6 - plagiarism) is excluded.

### [10] - ADJUSTMENTS TO THIS TERMS OF USE

This terms of use may be updated in the future. New rules that are added to the terms of use document apply to all users, no matter if they
have started using the repository before the new rules were in effect. It is the responsibility of the user to comply with the terms of use. While I understand that this might influence and impact the way how users use and (have) interact(ed) with the Vault, I will do my best to only implement new rules in the terms of use that revolve around copyrights issues and general oversights. If the terms of use is updated, I will add a reason in the changelog.
